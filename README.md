# YOUTRACK-cli tool

An command line tool wriiten in RUBY for the youtrack API. 

---

## Installation

If you dont have ruby then install it...you dont need to know how to write or understand ruby to use this tool but you need to have ruby installed to configure it.

---

- Once you have a recent version of ruby installed clone the repository down to your desired location
- From within the repository run
 ```
  bundle install
 ```
- To run the program manually you would run: 
```
ruby main.rb <arguments>
```
- BUt screw that..... Set an alias for that command in your bashrc file to "youtrack". Then you can just run:
```
youtrack <arguments>
```
---

## Notes

There is more work to be done....basic functionality is nearly complete. I will eventually write a small bash script or something you can run to download and install ruby and then run a bundle install for those who need it. Documentation is coming soon. Including beefing out the youtrack command with some help information and how to interact with the tool
